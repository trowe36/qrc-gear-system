1. get payment and signoff details when user logs in - load signoff into an enum state variable with db value mapping to enum skill name. 
2. user borrows gear. displays in 'view my loans' -> payment and signoff dependent -> see later stories 

3. SIGNOFF status and userpaymentstatus affects ability to borrow
4. user see their loans 
5. after that finsih admin panel:
    -loading gear into db, types etc (naynay talk)
    -sort gear orders by pickup date and location, user, gear type 
    - mark gear 'pending' pickup 'onloan'. (maybe have another table) - or col in order table for status, eg  Pending/onloan/ when return. delete from orders row, add to legacy orders table. 
    - 

Latest notes: 
-add availability status to gear ag grid 
- automatically calculate availability date when adding new gear to table 
-add sorting 
- user borrows gear, adds to orders table & affects gear table values, status etc 
    -> then start workjing on admin loan check off homePage
     -> check orders as 'pickup up' start working on return functionality.
